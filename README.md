# NASA APOD Request

## Synopsis

A simple website that makes a request to NASA's [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/) (APOD) and sets it as the background image. Created to be used with [Plash](https://github.com/sindresorhus/Plash). Checks every hour for a new picture.

NOTE: This website uses a demo key from NASA, which is limited to 50 requests per IP address per day. If you would like, you can sign up for your own [API key from NASA](https://api.nasa.gov) and use that instead.
